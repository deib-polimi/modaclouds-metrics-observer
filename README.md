The MODAClouds Metrics ObServer
=======================

In the context of MODAClouds European project (www.modaclouds.eu), Politecnico was
one of the partners involved in the development of the Monitoring Platform.

A metrics observer is any component that registers to the monitoring platform 
in order to receive specific data about a metric.

Please refer to deliverable [D6.3.2](http://www.modaclouds.eu/publications/public-deliverables/) 
to better understand the role of this component in the MODAClouds Monitoring Platform.
