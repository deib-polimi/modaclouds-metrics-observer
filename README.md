The MODAClouds Metrics ObServer
=======================

> The metrics observer library is not maintened anymore since the concept of observer for Tower 4Clouds was extended to allow multiple kind of serialization formats and multiple protocols, have a look at the new [Tower 4Clouds documentation](https://github.com/deib-polimi/tower4clouds) for details.
------

In the context of MODAClouds European project (www.modaclouds.eu), Politecnico was
one of the partners involved in the development of the Monitoring Platform.

A metrics observer is any component that registers to the monitoring platform 
in order to receive specific data about a metric.

Please refer to deliverable [D6.3.2](http://www.modaclouds.eu/publications/public-deliverables/) 
to better understand the role of this component in the MODAClouds Monitoring Platform.
